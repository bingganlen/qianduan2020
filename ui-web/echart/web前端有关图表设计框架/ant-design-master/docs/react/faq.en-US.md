### Are you going to provide Vue(etc...) edition?

No, but [the LICENSE of ant-design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/LICENSE) is MIT. So, you can try to implement it with ant-design's [style](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/tree/master/style), like: [ant-design-vue](https://github.com/vueComponent/ant-design-vue) [vue-beauty](https://github.com/FE-Driver/vue-beauty) or [antue](https://github.com/zzuu666/antue).

### Are you going to provide Sass/Stylus(etc...) style file?

No, actually, you can convert Less to Sass/Stylus(etc...) with tools (which you can Google).

### How to modify the default theme of Ant Design?

See: https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme .

### Would you supply other themes?

No, we follow Ant Design specification. https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/1241

### How to modify `Menu`/`Button`(etc...)'s style?

You can override its style, but we don't recommend doing so. antd is not only a set of React components but also a design specification.

### I just want to use `Menu`/`Button`(etc...), but it seems that I have to import the whole antd and its style.

Try [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import), or import what you need in this way:

```jsx
import Menu from 'antd/lib/menu';
import 'antd/lib/menu/style/css';
```

or (ES6 way with tree shaking):

```jsx
import { Menu, Breadcrumb, Icon } from 'antd';
```

### How to optimize momentjs bundle size with webpack?

See: https://github.com/jmblog/how-to-optimize-momentjs-with-webpack

### It doesn't work when I change `defaultValue` dynamically.

The `defaultXxxx` (like `defaultValue`) of `Input`/`Select`(etc...) only works in first render. It is a specification of React; please read [React's documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

### I set the `value` of `Input`/`Select`(etc...), and then, it cannot be changed by user's action.

Try `defaultValue` or `onChange` to change `value`, and please read [React's documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

### antd override my global styles!

Yes, antd is designed to develop a complete background application, we override some global styles for styling convenience, and it can't be removed now. More info trace https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/4331 .

Or, follow the instructions in [How to avoid modifying global styles?](docs/react/customize-theme#How-to-avoid-modifying-global-styles-?)

### I cannot install `antd` and `antd`'s dependencies(etc...). FYI, I live in China mainland.

Long live the Girl Friend Wall! And try [cnpm](http://npm.taobao.org/).

### I set `dependencies.antd` as git repository in package.json, but it doesn't work.

Yes, please install `antd` with npm.

### `message` and `notification` is lower case, but other components are capitalized. Typo?

No, as `message` is just a function, not a React Component.

### `antd` doesn't work well in mobile.

Please check [And Design Mobile](http://mobile.ant.design) for details. `antd` has not been optimized to do so. You may try [react-component](https://github.com/react-component/), those repositories which start with 'm-' 'rn-' are designed for mobile.

### Does `antd` supply standalone files like 'react' do?

Yep, you can [import `antd` with script tag](https://ant.design/docs/react/install?locale=en-US#Import-in-Browser). But we recommend using `npm` to import `antd`, it is simple and easy to maintain.

### I can't visit `icon` in my network environment.

You should deploy the iconfont files to your network by following this [example](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-init/tree/7c1a33cadb98f2fd8688fe527dd7f98215b9bced/examples/local-iconfont). [#1070](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/1070)

After 3.9.x [we are using svg icon](/components/icon#svg-icons), so you don't need to deploy iconfont locally anymore!

### How to extend antd's components?

If you need some features which should not be included in antd, try to extend antd's component with [HOC](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/ef0bf1f338a7182b6775). [more](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.eeu8q01s1)

### How to fix dynamic style when open Content Security Policy (CSP)?

You can config `nonce` by [ConfigProvider](/components/config-provider/#Content-Security-Policy).

### How to spell Ant Design correctly?

## Errors & Warnings

Here are some errors & warnings that you may meet while using antd, but most of them are not bugs of antd.

### Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag

An [answer from StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25034994/how-to-correctly-wrap-few-td-tags-for-jsxtransformer), and please read [React's documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/displaying-data.html#components-are-just-like-functions).

### React.createElement: type should not be null, undefined, boolean, or number. It should be a string (for DOM elements) or a ReactClass (for composite components)

Please make sure that you import `antd`'s components correctly. Read the corresponding documentation of the `antd`'s version which you use, and pay attention to typos.

### rm is not recognized as an internal or external command

### Failed propType: Invalid prop `AAA` of type `BBB` supplied to `CCC`, expected `DDD`. Check the render method of `EEE`.

Please read the corresponding documentation of the `antd`'s version which you use, and make sure that you pass values with correct type to `antd`'s components,

### Unknown option: xxx/package.json.presets

An [answer from Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33685365/unknown-option-babelrc-presets).

### Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(...): Unable to find element.

You may import React twice. Set React & ReactDOM as external, if you are using webpack, See [#525](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/525). If you are using others (browserify, etc...), please read its documentation and find options which can set React & ReactDOM as external.
